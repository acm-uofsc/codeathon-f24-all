Here are the steps worked out:

	4 z 5 y 2 w 7    
    4 z 5 y 9
    4 z 14
    56

w has the highest precedence, and represents +, evaluating 2 and 7 to 9. 'y' has the next highest, and is also '+', making the equation `4 z 14`. 'z' is multiply, resulting in `56`

Here is the second problem worked out:

    5 y 8 x 4 z 9 w 6
    5 y 8 x 4 z 15
    5 y 32 z 15
    37 z 15
    555
